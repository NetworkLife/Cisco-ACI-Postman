# Cisco-ACI-Postman
A collection of my global scripts for ACI

# Getting Started
Copy and past them to the body of your POST request to (https://{{APIC-hostname}}/api/mo/uni.xml).

# Disclaimer
I'm not a dev, this is NOT fancy code. 
It does work (for me at least!) though. 
You can seriously mess up your ACI fabric with my scripts if you don't know what you're doing. 
I take no responsibility for that :)
